        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This grilled tri-tip recipe with a tasty dry rub tastes gourmet but is actually very easy to make. It's a perfect dinner for guests. It is sure to impress!</p>
        
        <p>Tri-Tip is not a common cut where I live so I usually call the butcher at my local grocery store and request it the day before I need to prepare it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds tri-tip roast</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup garlic salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast: insert garlic slices into the slits</li>
            <li>Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl: rub all over the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Remove tri-tip fro the refrigerator about 20 minutes before grilling</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
            <li>Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices, about 5 to 10 minutes per side</li>
            <li>Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, for another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing</li>
        </ol>
